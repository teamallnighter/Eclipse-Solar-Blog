EMCO Energy is a local energy and internet provider that is 100% non-profit. We reinvest all of the revenues from your energy bills into local tech development, student programs, and community projects. If you could get lower energy rates and at the same time help to fund local initiatives, would you switch providers? What if we covered the deposit fees for you and waived the credit check? If that sounds good to you then click here to visit our website and sign up so that you too can help support local tech development and our local economy:
