I have always been committed to designing and seeking out high-performance solutions for those who value sustainability and reducing their impact on the environment.  
  
My time is currently dedicated to being the CEO/President of both The Meta Space, and EMCO Sustainability Projects, a company that I co-founded in 2014. I also spend time volunteering for a non-profit called the GO Technology Foundation (GO Tech) which I am a founding member of and currently sit as the Vice-Chair and Director of EMCO Energy, GO Tech's energy retail initiative that helps fund the organization and the various projects we are working on.  
  
My focus through all of these roles is to find ways of creating regenerative systems that go beyond sustainability and continuously improve the world around us through integrating or developing disruptive technologies.  
  
It's time to fast track ourselves into the Fourth Industrial Revolution!!
